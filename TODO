Short-term:
-Make the program robust against interruption (atomic commits to the database, etc.)
-Parse more gnumake syntax
-Use gettext

Medium-term:
-Implement a jam parser
-Implement something to output the dependency database to graphviz (separate program?)

Long-term:
-Turn everything except the parsers and driver into a library that can be shared among the backends.
-See if I can use this as a backend with gnumake's frontend
-Implement a daemon mode that monitors the filesystem for changes to any dependencies
